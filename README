Symbols for gschem, the gEDA schematic editor suite.

I Added a directory structure to reflect the usage of the symbol.

"components" for component symbols (heavy).
  - component symbols without any *_*.sym suffix might have hidden power nets included.
  - component symbols with a *_np.sym suffix have no power nets included.
  - component symbols with a *_pp.sym suffix have explicit power pins.
  - component symbols with a *_pwr.sym suffix are detached power pins (Vcc and GND).

"generic" for generic components (light).

"ghdl" for schematic entry of VHDL logic (specific for GHDL).

"installation" for floor plans of houses and other real estate.

"ladder" for ladder diagram symbols.

"mechanical" for references in schematics to mechanical entities.

"network" for computer networks.

"piping" for Piping and Process & Instrumentation Diagrams.

"power" for reference to power/ground symbols.

"sheets" template drawing sheets.

"units" for representation of sub assemblies.

"vhdl" for schematic entry of VHDL logic.
